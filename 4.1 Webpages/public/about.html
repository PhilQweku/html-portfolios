<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Phil Qweku is my name. A young and energetic guy in my mid 20s.</p>
<p>I am web developer and a computer programmer. I love to spend most of my time coding and decoding.
  I have a great love for kids and also love to impact in my generation. 
  Based on that I have taken teaching up as a job with which I am able to help young kids of my generation learn a whole lot.
</p>
<p>A lot of my work out there speaks for me because I am not too good with talking about myself.
  Especially most of the websites I have built over the years portrays who I truly am.
